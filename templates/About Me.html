        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="about">I would like to be an editor so that I can use Adobe Premiere Pro. It is important to learn Premiere Pro so that my edits are the best that they can be. I look forward to creating/editing videos or movies. My target audience is anyone above the age of 13. The tools I know how to use are Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and a little Premiere Pro. The skills I have are time management and I have a drive to improve at what I do.</p>

        <h1>Skills in Media</h1>
        <p class="about">I also can balance out exposure with a camera using the manual settings like shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. I know how to us different camera rigs such as drones and underwater mount, and camera movements such as dolly zooms and pans/whip pans. I can use different camera angles like the low angle, high angle, dutch angle, and others to produce different types of emotions from the audience.</p>
